It is located to the west of the Garonne River, south of the city of Bordeaux. The name Graves comes from its intense, gravelly soil, a very important characteristic for a quality wine. Indeed, gravelly soil enables drainage, preventing grapes from having too much water.</p><p><br></p><p>This morning visit a château in the Graves wine sub-region and taste white and red wines of the Pessac-Léognan AOC (Appellation d’Origins Contrôlée). Pessac-Léognan is located in the northern part of the Graves wine sub-region and, unlike most Bordeaux appellations, is equally famous for both red and (dry) white wines although red wine is still predominant (wine tasting at own expense).</p><p><br></p><p>In the afternoon enjoy a visit of the picturesque town of Saint-Émilion (UNESCO world heritage) with its Medieval and Roman vestiges, nestling in a beautiful setting amid vineyards first cultivated by the Romans in the 2nd century. There is a great amount of preserved heritage to see: cloisters, churches, half-timbered houses, old mills, castles. Take your time to stroll along the pretty narrow streets.</p><p><br></p><p>Spend the rest of your day visiting two châteaux in the Libournais sub-region of the Bordeaux wine area, located to the north of the Dordogne river, east of the city of Bordeaux. It includes, among others, the Saint-Émilion AOC and the Pomerol AOC (wine tasting at own expense).</p><p><br></p><p>Visiting a wine estate is an enriching experience. Walking through the vines listening to a winegrower's explanations will enable you to become acquainted with viticulture methods, while a tour of the barrel cellar, followed by tutored tasting, will provide a rare opportunity to discuss the nuts and bolts of wine-making with your host.</p><p><br></p><p><em>Pick up and drop off in Bordeaux - Lunch at own expenses - Wine tastings are to be paid directly on site.</em></p><p><br></p><p><em>Duration: 8 hours</em></p><p><strong>﻿</strong></p><p><strong>Overnight stay including breakfast at a historic boutique hotel in the heart of Bordeaux</strong></p><p><br></p>","included_list":"transportation, driver / guide, bedroom and breakfast","duration":"00:00","distance":0,"decline":0,"start_time":"12:00:00","end_time":null,"medias":[{"kind":"picture","value":"http://cdn-pictures.toogo.in/original/6cf46f89/769efcce220c3bb4eb0801951a0ca2ff67708856ade843b5372d55776dbf6528/product_days/saint20emilion.jpg"},{"kind":"picture","value":"http://cdn-pictures.toogo.in/original/6cf46f89/769efcce220c3bb4eb0801951a0ca2ff67708856ade843b5372d55776dbf6528/product_days/saint20emilion.jpg"}],"itinerary":[{"id":"704","place":"Saint Emilion","latitude":"44.885066494015","longitude":"-0.16067504882812"},{"id":"112","place":"Bordeaux","latitude":"44.8247082823","longitude":"-0.516357421875"},{"id":"704","place":"Saint Emilion","latitude":"44.885066494015","longitude":"-0.16067504882812"},{"id":"112","place":"Bordeaux","latitude":"44.8247082823","longitude":"-0.516357421875"},{"id":"704","place":"Saint Emilion","latitude":"44.885066494015","longitude":"-0.16067504882812"},{"id":"112","place":"Bordeaux","latitude":"44.8247082823","longitude":"-0.516357421875"},{"id":"704","place":"Saint Emilion","latitude":"44.885066494015","longitude":"-0.16067504882812"},{"id":"112","place":"Bordeaux","latitude":"44.8247082823","longitude":"-0.516357421875"}]}},"8":{"day":8,"dayProgram":{"title":"Bordeaux","description":"<p><br></p><p><strong>Private tour of Arcachon and visit of the Dune du Pilat </strong></p><p><br></p><p>An English speaking private driver will pick you up at your accommodation and drive you safely to the various sites and activities of the day.</p><p><br></p><p>The resort town of Arcachon is a very popular coastal destination in south-west France. Born as a destination for people from Bordeaux to escape to on weekends, it has now developed into one of the best-known and mots attractive seaside destinations in France.</p><p><br></p><p>The principal attractions in Arcachon include several kilometers of beautifully maintained sandy beaches, the town center with its markets and vibrant atmosphere, and the 'winter town' (the \"ville d'hiver\") with its extensive number of grand villas built in the 1860's - the most complete 'belle epoque' town you will find anywhere in France.</p><p><br></p><p>The beach in the center of Arcachon is not exposed to the full might of the Atlantic waves, being on the edge of a large inlet, the Arcachon Basin, rather than facing the sea directly. This makes the beaches particularly good for children. If you are looking for something further afield then there are literally miles of white sandy beaches as you continue south towards Biscarrosse, backed by pine forests and with plenty of waves for surfing and body-boarding.</p><p><br></p><p>The winter town grew in the second half of the 19th century, particularly around 1860 when a group of businessmen decided to prolong Arcachon's popular summer season into winter by promoting it as a rival to the Swiss mountains as a 'cure' for tuberculosis. The “ville d'hiver” contains numerous grand villas dating from the last two decades of the 19th century. The 'Mode Pittoresque' was fashionable at this time and is a wonderfully eccentric mix of a number of architectural styles and building materials. In Arcachon you can see a mix of neoclassical, neo-gothic, old-colonial and Swiss chalet styles. A lack of symmetry is key and the styles incorporate mixes of chalet style roofs with brick facades and bay windows.</p><p><br></p><p>The seafood restaurants in Arcachon are of course particularly popular and if you are looking for a cheap but tasty treat, 'moules frites' (mussels and chips) are offered in many of the restaurants along the beach. Head a short distance away from the beach front and it is easier to find restaurants offering high quality food at decent prices.</p><p><br></p><p>The Oyster House invites you to discover the art of oyster farming, rearing techniques and the history of the French oysters over the centuries. With 7 ports along its coastline, the many oyster farms, the high school of the sea, traditional huts and oyster tastings, Gujan-Mestras is the capital of the oysters in Arcachon Bay. After visiting the Oyster House, oyster tasting is a must! Visit one of the 12 tasting cabins present in the various ports of Gujan-Mestras (own expenses) and indulge in a local culinary experience.</p><p><br></p><p>Make the best of your afternoon and visit the Dune of Pilat, the tallest sand dune in Europe, an exceptional natural site near Arcachon. The dune is almost 110-meters high. From the top you can admire the splendid views over the Atlantic ocean.</p><p><br></p><p><em>Pick up and drop off in Bordeaux - Lunch at own expenses - Entrance fees to be paid directly on site.</em></p><p><br></p><p><em> Duration: 8 hours.</em></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><strong>﻿</strong></p><p><strong>Overnight stay including breakfast at a historic boutique hotel in the heart of Bordeaux</strong></p><p><br></p>","included_list":"transportation, driver / guide, bedroom and breakfast","duration":"00:00","distance":0,"decline":0,"start_time":"12:00:00","end_time":null,"medias":[{"kind":"picture","value":"http://cdn-pictures.toogo.in/original/6cf46f89/769efcce220c3bb4eb0801951a0ca2ff67708856ade843b5372d55776dbf6528/product_days/14864670507814.jpg"},{"kind":"picture","value":"http://cdn-pictures.toogo.in/original/6cf46f89/769efcce220c3bb4eb0801951a0ca2ff67708856ade843b5372d55776dbf6528/product_days/14864670507814.jpg"}],"itinerary":[{"id":"112","place":"Bordeaux","latitude":"44.8247082823","longitude":"-0.516357421875"}]}},"9":{"day":9,"dayProgram":{"title":"Bordeaux - Paris - Paris","description":"<p><br></p><p><strong>Private transfer to the railway station</strong></p><p><br></p><p>A private driver will pick you up at your hotel and drive you safely to the railway station.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Train ride in 2nd class from Paris to Bordeaux (in a comfortable high-speed train/TGV)</strong></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Private transfer to your accommodation</strong></p><p><br></p><p>A private driver will pick you up at the railway station and drive you safely to your accommodation.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Lunch Cruise on the Seine</strong></p><p><br></p><p>The Seine is one of the world’s most urban rivers, flanked by the emblematic monuments of Paris.</p><p><br></p><p>This is an ideal opportunity combining lunch with a cruise on the Seine alongside the splendid panorama of the city’s historic buildings.

During the day your guide will discuss a lot of topics about the war (from German occupation to French Resistance) and speak about many different soldiers’ war stories.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>After a quick stop at the German Cemetery, the largest one in Normandy with over 21.000 people buried here, you will head to Sainte-Mere-Eglise. Ideally situated between Cherbourg and the coast, this farming community became the very center of the huge airborne operation (with 15.000 U.S. paratroopers) that started during the night before D-Day. The Airborne Museum has been gathering an amazing collection of memorabilia, in particular in the form of donations from the veterans themselves.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>You will then visit Utah Beach. Closest to the Germans and quite separated from the other beaches, it could have been a disaster. But Utah Beach was rather lightly defended and had the great privilege to be protected by the American paratroopers (who had been in the area for several hours already).</p><p>As they jumped out of their landing craft, the soldiers of the 4th Infantry Division managed to get rapidly across the flooded area behind the sand dunes to reinforce the paratroopers. On D-Day, 23.000 landed here and casualties remained low under 200.</p><p><br></p><p>A stop at Pointe du Hoc, the largest German coastal battery attacked by the U.S Rangers on D-Day, will put you right in the atmosphere - the beach, the cliff, the bunkers, the bomb craters - before making a stop at the best-known Bloody Omaha.</p><p><br></p><p>The most famous and most difficult of the five D-day beaches. Omaha Beach took the highest casualties, due in particular to its topography: it was the only beach with high ground just beyond. Standing there and seeing this beach (4 miles long) all at once, when realizing about the big tides and discovering the German fortifications and gun emplacements, will leave you amazed at the extraordinary courage and sacrifice needed. You will understand why the 1st and 29th Infantry Divisions suffered more than 3 800 casualties (dead, wounded or missing) to make this battle a victory.</p><p><br></p><p>The last stop of the tour will be at the U.S cemetery, for yet another perspective of the beach from the high ground. The Normandy American Cemetery is the final resting place for 9.387 Americans. It covers 172 acres and is an actual battleground as it overlooks the “Easy Red” sector of Omaha Beach. Soldiers all equal in death and their graves in no particular order, they are all marked with the same beautiful Italian white marble headstones. Your guide will then give you the time to stay longer in the cemetery or save time for the Visitor Center, also next to Omaha Beach.</p><p><br></p><p><em>Pick up and drop off in Bayeux - Lunch at own expenses; museum entrance fees to be paid directly on site.</em></p><p><em> </em></p><p><em>Duration: 9 hours</em></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Overnight stay including breakfast at a château-hôtel in Bayeux</strong></p><p><strong>﻿</strong></p>","included_list":"transportation, excursion, chauffeur / guide, bedroom and breakfast","duration":"56:59","distance":0,"decline":0,"start_time":"14:00:00","end_time":"11:00:00","medias":[{"kind":"picture","value":"http://cdn-pictures.toogo.in/original/6cf46f89/769efcce220c3bb4eb0801951a0ca2ff67708856ade843b5372d55776dbf6528/product_days/war-cemetery-2769053_960_720.jpg"},{"kind":"picture","value":"http://cdn-pictures.toogo.in/original/6cf46f89/769efcce220c3bb4eb0801951a0ca2ff67708856ade843b5372d55776dbf6528/product_days/war-cemetery-2769053_960_720.jpg"},{"kind":"picture","value":"http://cdn-pictures.toogo.in/original/6cf46f89/769efcce220c3bb4eb0801951a0ca2ff67708856ade843b5372d55776dbf6528/product_days/war-cemetery-2769053_960_720.jpg"}],"itinerary":[{"id":"96","place":"Bayeux","latitude":"49.277717","longitude":"-0.709032"}]}},"4":{"day":4,"dayProgram":{"title":"Bayeux - Paris - Paris","description":"<p><strong style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;\">Private transfer from Bayeux to Paris</strong></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;\">A private driver will pick you up at your accommodation in Bayeux and drive you safely to your accommodation in Paris (approximately 270km).</span></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Overnight stay including breakfast at a charming 4* hotel in the historic Le Marais district in a superior room </strong></p><p><br></p>","included_list":"transportation, bedroom and breakfast","duration":"00:00","distance":0,"decline":0,"start_time":null,"end_time":null,"medias":[{"kind":"picture","value":"http://cdn-pictures.toogo.in/original/6cf46f89/769efcce220c3bb4eb0801951a0ca2ff67708856ade843b5372d55776dbf6528/product_days/bayeux_centre.jpg"}],"itinerary":[{"id":"509","place":"Paris","latitude":"48.857487002645","longitude":"2.3538208007812"},{"id":"96","place":"Bayeux","latitude":"49.277717","longitude":"-0.709032"},{"id":"509","place":"Paris","latitude":"48.857487002645","longitude":"2.3538208007812"},{"id":"1","place":"Paris","latitude":"48.863129","longitude":"2.336911"}]}},"5":{"day":5,"dayProgram":{"title":"Paris - Reims - Rilly-la-Montagne","description":"<p><br></p><p><strong>Private Guided Day Tour in Champagne - Part 1</strong></p><p><br></p><p>Pick-up at your hotel in Paris and meeting with your English-speaking driver-guide.</p><p><br></p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">Full-day private transportation in full option Mercedes V-Class for 1 day in Champagne.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><br></p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">Your&nbsp;day begins with the discovery of a domain located in the&nbsp;Marne Valley.
